# Automatic-Plant-Irrigation-System-using-PIC12F675-Sensing-Nodes-Involving-Effective-Water-Management
This project presents an Automatic Plant Irrigation System designed using the PIC12F675 microcontroller and soil moisture sensing nodes to enable effective water management. The system monitors the soil’s moisture level in real time and automatically activates or deactivates the water pump/valve based on the plant’s requirements. By supplying only the required amount of water, it prevents both under- and over-irrigation, ensuring healthy plant growth while conserving water. The compact, low-cost, and energy-efficient design makes it suitable for home gardens, greenhouses, and agricultural applications, offering a smart solution for sustainable irrigation practices
